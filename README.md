1.This is about to display the 10 images from giphy website using my API by using buttons.
2.Then if i click any of those button it should grab appropriate image from giphy
3.After that i need to animate those images when i click on the images and as well as animamtion should stop when    i click back on the animamted images.
4.Then i need to create a search button and when users search on that button it have to be add or append into        buttons which already created and should display the images .
5.So i have used html and js file with ajax to cretae this app.
